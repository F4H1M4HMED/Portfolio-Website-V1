            <h3>Library Management System</h3>
            <p>The Python Library project involved creating a simple library management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project comprised two main classes: Book and Library. The Book class managed attributes such as title, author, and copies. It featured methods for displaying book information, borrowing a book (which decreased the number of available copies), and returning a book (which increased the number of copies).

                The Library class was designed to manage a collection of Book instances. It included methods for adding books to the library's inventory, displaying all books, and finding a specific book by its title. The implementation of these classes demonstrated practical use of OOP concepts like encapsulation and object interaction, providing a foundational understanding of how to structure and manage a simple library system programmatically.</p>

            <h3>Store Management System</h3>
            <p>The Store project involved developing a simplified retail management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project included four main classes: Product, Cart, Customer, and Store. The Product class encapsulated attributes like name, price, and quantity_in_stock, with methods to display product information and manage stock levels. The Cart class managed items added by customers, allowing for adding and removing products, and displaying the cartâ€™s contents.

                The Customer class represented individuals interacting with the store, providing methods to add products to a cart and proceed with checkout, which involved calculating the total cost and updating product stock accordingly. Finally, the Store class acted as the central hub for managing inventory, including adding and removing products and processing customer purchases. This project demonstrated the use of OOP concepts to model a real-world retail system, highlighting how classes and objects interact to manage store operations and customer transactions.</p>
